# Search and Sorting Algorithm Visualizations

This project includes simple implementations and visualizations of **Linear Search** and **Bubble Sort** algorithms using Python and Matplotlib. It helps to understand how these algorithms work step-by-step with visual feedback.

## 📌 Algorithms Implemented

### 🔍 Linear Search
- Checks each element in a list until the target is found or list ends.
- Time Complexity: **O(n)**
- Visualization:
  - Highlights current element (yellow)
  - Turns green if the element is found
  - Turns red if not found

### 🔁 Bubble Sort
- Compares and swaps adjacent elements to sort the list.
- Time Complexity: **O(n²)**
- Visualization:
  - Shows comparisons (yellow)
  - Sorted values appear in green

## 🧪 Time Complexity Comparison

- Included a performance comparison graph between Bubble Sort and Linear Search.
- Demonstrates how algorithm efficiency drops as input size increases.

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Linear Search is simple but inefficient on large datasets.
- Bubble Sort is easy to understand but not practical for large arrays.
- Better alternatives: Quick Sort, Merge Sort for sorting; Binary Search for searching.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- PyCharm (IDE)
- Matplotlib
- Random module
